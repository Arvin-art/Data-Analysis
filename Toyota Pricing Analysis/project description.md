## README - Toyota Data Analysis

### Overview:

This document provides a detailed explanation of the analysis performed using the dataset in the provided Excel file. The analysis focuses on understanding various factors affecting the pricing of Toyota vehicles based on the given dataset and the subsequent modeling and data processing steps.

### Sheets Breakdown:

1. **Original Data:**

   * Contains the initial dataset with key variables such as Price, Age, KM, HP, and additional vehicle features like Metallic Rim, Radio Cassette, Parking Assistant, etc.
   * The data serves as the base for all further modifications and model building.

2. **Model\_1:**

   * Presents the results of the first regression model analysis. Key metrics included are:

     * Multiple R: 0.9168
     * R Square: 0.8406
     * Adjusted R Square: 0.8381
   * The model examines the relationship between the vehicle price and multiple features.

3. **Modified\_data:**

   * A refined version of the original dataset with selected variables.
   * The sheet consolidates key features for a more targeted regression analysis, potentially excluding less relevant features.

4. **Model\_2:**

   * Contains the output of the second regression model.
   * Key metrics:

     * Multiple R: 0.9164
     * R Square: 0.8399
     * Adjusted R Square: 0.8385
   * This model is fine-tuned based on the modified data and includes a commentary on the differences in performance from the first model.

5. **Plot:**

   * A placeholder or incomplete sheet likely intended for graphical representations of model outputs or data distribution.

6. **New Data:**

   * Contains predicted values calculated using the second model and the corresponding feature values.
   * Additionally, it includes coefficients used in the model calculation for interpretability.

7. **Description:**

   * Provides descriptions of the variables used in the dataset, aiding in understanding the context and meaning of each feature.

8. **XLM\_Matrix1:**

   * Contains data normalization or transformation metrics, including data minimums, maximums, and axis step values.
   * Provides insights into data scaling used during model development.

### Analysis Summary:

* The data was processed and analyzed using linear regression models to assess the impact of various features on vehicle pricing.
* Adjustments were made to the dataset to improve model accuracy, as seen in the transition from Model\_1 to Model\_2.
* Key findings highlight significant relationships between vehicle age, mileage, and other vehicle features in determining price.
