### Project Title: Earthquakes Analysis Project

### Author: Arvind Shiv Tej Reddy Gongati

### Project Overview:

This project involves the analysis of earthquake data to identify patterns and insights regarding the magnitude, frequency, and distribution of earthquakes over time. Using a dataset spanning from 1900 to 2013, visualizations were created to present key findings effectively. Tableau was used to construct interactive dashboards, including visualizations such as a box plot, map visualizations, and top counts of earthquake occurrences by year.

### Objectives:

* Identify the top three years with the highest magnitude earthquakes.
* Analyze the distribution of earthquake magnitudes using box plots.
* Visualize the geographic clustering of earthquakes based on magnitude.
* Highlight the occurrences of specific magnitude types (‘mwr’ and ‘mwp’).
* Showcase top 10 years with the highest earthquake counts.

### Analysis and Findings:

1. **Top 3 Years with Maximum Magnitude Earthquakes:**

   * The analysis identified the top three years with the maximum earthquake magnitudes as 1960, 1964, and 2004. These years experienced the highest magnitude earthquakes, demonstrating the intensity and impact of seismic activities during these periods.

2. **Magnitude Distribution Analysis (Box Plot):**

   * The box plot analysis revealed that the median magnitude of the earthquakes was 8.0. The maximum magnitude recorded was 9.6 in 1960, and the minimum was 6.9 in 2014. The data exhibited a right-skewed distribution, indicating that most earthquakes fell within the 6 to 8 magnitude range.

3. **Geographical Clustering of Earthquakes (Map Visualization):**

   * Clustering analysis using k-means clustering identified that Cluster 1 experienced the maximum magnitude earthquakes. The visualization effectively highlights regions with higher seismic activity, aiding in identifying potential high-risk areas.

4. **Magnitude Type Analysis (‘mwr’ and ‘mwp’):**

   * Specific magnitude types (‘mwr’ and ‘mwp’) were analyzed to understand their distribution across regions. The visualizations provide a comprehensive view of how these types of magnitudes are spread geographically.

5. **Top 10 Years by Earthquake Count:**

   * A bar chart visualization showcased the top 10 years with the highest earthquake counts. The year 2011 had the highest count with 207 recorded earthquakes. The trend analysis indicates a noticeable increase in earthquake occurrences post-2000.

### Conclusion:

The Earthquakes Analysis Project successfully provided valuable insights into earthquake magnitudes, frequency, and geographical distribution over time. The findings highlight critical years of high seismic activity, regions with concentrated earthquake occurrences, and the magnitude range most commonly observed. These insights can be instrumental in disaster management, preparedness, and risk mitigation strategies.
