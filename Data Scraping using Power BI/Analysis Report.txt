### Project Description:

The project "Web Scraping with Power BI" was undertaken to demonstrate data extraction from a live web page and to perform data analysis using Power BI. The selected data source was the Cricket World Cup 2023 standings page, which provided comprehensive statistics on team performance, including points gained, net run rate, games played, and games won by each participating country.

Web scraping was executed using Power BI's data connection capabilities, enabling the extraction of data from the specified URL. Data cleaning and transformation were carried out in the Power Query editor to ensure accurate and structured data for visualization.

### Data Analysis and Visualizations:

1. **Stacked Bar Chart - Points Gained by Each Team:**

   * This visualization depicted the points gained by each team throughout the World Cup. The Indian team emerged as the top-performing team with the highest points compared to other teams, indicating consistent performance and multiple match wins.

2. **Stacked Column Chart - Net Run Rate by Country:**

   * The net run rate of each team was analyzed using a stacked column chart. The South African team exhibited the highest run rate, reflecting a dominant performance despite having 2 points less than India. Conversely, the England team had the lowest run rate, indicating weaker performance throughout the tournament.

3. **Line Chart - Net Run Rate vs Points Scored:**

   * The relationship between net run rate and points scored was analyzed using a line chart. Although New Zealand and Australia secured the same number of wins, New Zealand's higher run rate suggested a stronger performance in terms of scoring efficiency.

4. **Clustered Column Chart - Games Played vs Games Won:**

   * A clustered column chart compared the number of games played against the number of games won by each team. India was the only team to maintain a 100% win rate, underscoring their dominance throughout the tournament.

### Insights and Recommendations:

* Indiaâ€™s consistent high performance is evident in both points gained and games won, making them the strongest contender based on current standings.
* South Africa's high run rate, despite lower points, suggests a potential for rapid scoring that could be capitalized on in future matches.
* The gap between net run rate and points scored for New Zealand highlights a need for stronger defensive strategies to convert high run rates into consistent wins.

### Conclusion:

The analysis provided a comprehensive overview of team performance in the 2023 Cricket World Cup, offering critical insights into winning strategies, scoring efficiency, and areas for improvement for each participating team.
